# 🧠 RAG-based Chatbot

This repository contains a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot project. It is divided into two main components:

- `RAG/` — Code related to retrieval-augmented generation using local documents and LLMs.
- `chatbot/` — The main chatbot logic, potentially integrating the RAG pipeline and managing user interactions.
